# vim
vim (VI improved) is an editor that works very well in a terminal
environment.  The application is quite powerful, and allows very fast
navigation and edits in files with very few keystrokes (and hardly any
crtl, alt, which makes it RSI friendly).

  1. The `.vimrc` file in your home directory helps making using vim a
    lot easier and convenient.  Tastes differ, but I can recommend
    [mine](vimrc.md).
