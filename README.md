=================

A collection of code examples for training purposes, mostly in the
context of data processing and parallel prgramming.

This material is made available as is, i.e., anyone is free to use it,
and to contribute.  However, no support is guaranteed in any form.  It
is subject to the license included in this repository.

What is it?
-----------
* `Accelerators`: some sample code and information on using accelerators.
* `C`: some C sample code. (Work in progress)
* `CPlusPlus`: some C++ sample code. (Work in progress)
* `DataStorage`: sample code showing how to read/write HDF5 and NetCDF
    files from C, Fortran, and Python.  HDF5 can be used for parallel I/O,
    C sample code is provided.  The HDF5 material is part of a tutorial on
    that subject.  Sample code on how to interact with a redis data
    structure server is also provided, illustrating the hiredis C API.
    Sample SQLcovers the basics of querying relational databases
* `Debugging`: slides used for an info session on debugging tools and
    techniques, as well as sample code.
* `Fortran`: sample Fortran code intended to illustrate Fortran 95, 2003,
    and 2008 features.  This material is developed in preparation of a
    tutorial on modern Fortran features.
* `Java`: sample code mostly for demonstration purposes.
* `LinuxTools`: some illustrations of using Linux tools such as the `M4`
    macro processor, make files and autotools, as well as slides on
    version control using svn and git.
* `Math`: sample code for using various mathematical libraries.
* `Mpi`: illustration of distributed programming using the Message Passing
    Interface API.
* `OpenMP`: sample code for OpenMP.
* `Optimization`: illustrations of performance optimization opportunities.
* `PBS`: sample PBS torque batch scripts to illustrate features.
* `Python`: sample code to explore various Python features, standard
    library packages and third party libraries.  Most of this material is
    used in a tutorial on using Python for scientific data processing.
* `R`: some very simple illustrations of how to run R scripts from the
    command line, and to submit as (PBS) jobs
* `Spark`: some Spark-related material. (Work in progress)
* `Visualization`: data files, XDMF files and ParaView state files to
    use during a demo of scientific visualization with ParaView.
