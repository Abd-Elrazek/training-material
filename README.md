What is it?
-----------
A collection of code examples for training purposes, mostly in the
context of data processing and parallel prgramming.

This material is made available as is, i.e., anyone is free to use it,
and to contribute.  However, no support is guaranteed in any form.  It

* `Fortran`: sample Fortran code intended to illustrate Fortran 95, 2003,
  and 2008 features.  This material is developed in preparation of a
  tutorial on modern Fortran featurs.
* `HDF5`: sample code showing how to read/write HDF5 files from C and
  using HDF5 for parallel I/O.  This material is part of a tutorial on
  HDF5.
* `NetCDF`: sample code showing how to read/write NetCDF files for C,
  Fortran and Python.  This material is prepared in preparation of
  extending the HDF5 tutorial to other data formats using in scientific
  computing.
* `Python`: sample code to explore various Python features, standard
  library packages and third party libraries.  Most of this material is
  used in a tutorial on using Python for scientific data processing.
* `Visualization`: data files, XDMF files and ParaView state files to
  use during a demo of scientific visualization with ParaView.
