# C99
Illustration of a few C99 features.

## What is it?
1. `bool.c`: using the Boolean C99 type, checks (very naively) whether a
    given number is prime.
1. `complex.c`: illustration of using complex constants, operators, and
    functions.
1. `vla.c`: variable length arrays, at runtime allocated on the stack.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build these applications.
