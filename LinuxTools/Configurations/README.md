# Configurations
Configuration files for various Linux tools that show some useful, but
non-default settings.

## What is it?
1. `screenrc`: screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes
    a physical terminal between several processes, allowing to detach
    and reattach sessions. This configuration file defines a status
    line at the bottom of the screen that shows the open windows, and
    highlights the one that is active.
