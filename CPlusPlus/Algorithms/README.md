# Algorithms
Code illustrations for chapter 10, Algorithms in Stroustrup's
"A tour of C++".

## What is it?
1. `accumulate.cpp`: simple illustration of using the `std::accumulate`
    function, and a trivial lambda function.
1. `find_if.cpp`: illustrates finding elements in collections using
    `std::find_if` and a closure lambda function.
1. `for_each.cpp`: illustration of modifying each element of an STL vector
    using `std::for_each` and a lambda function.
1. `generate.cpp`: illustration of generating the elements of a vector
    using `std::generate` and a lambda function.
1. `permutations.cpp`: illustration of generating the permutations of a
    vector using `std::next_permutation`.
1. `particle_sort.cpp`: illustrations of sorting structures based on
    various fields.
1. `count_clamp.cpp`: illustration of count and replace algorithms with
    predicates.
1. `zip_it.cpp`: illustration of using `transform` to use two sequences
    to produce a third.
1. `find_words.cpp`: illustrates using `search` for strings.
`. `text.txt`: text file to perform search on.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the code.
