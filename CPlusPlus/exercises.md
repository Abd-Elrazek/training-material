# Exercises
These are some exercises you can do as part of the C++ training.

## The basics (Chapter 1)

  1. Write a program that writes a greeting to standard output. When
    a command line argument is provided, e.g., `Bjarne`, the greeting
    should be `hello Bjarne!`, otherwise `hello world!`.
    [(Solution)](Basics/hello.cpp)
  1. Write a program that reads from standard input, and interpretes a
    string as a name.  It will write a greeting to standard output,
    unless it reads `quit`, then it will print `Bye!`.
    [(Solution)](Basics/talk.cpp)
  1. Write a program that computes the factorial function for a number
    specified on the command line.  [(Solution)](Basics/fac.cpp)
  1. Write a program that computes the greatest common divisor of
    two integers specified on the command line.
    [(Solution)](Basics/gcd.cpp)
  1. Write a program that uses three functions to
      1. initialize an array of `double` with the square roots of 0.0 up
        to the array's length minus one;
      2.  print that array to standard output; and
      3. compute the sum of the array elements, which is printed by the
        program.
  1. Write a program that implements two functions, the first to swap
    the values of two `int` variables, the second to swap the values of
    two `double` variables.  Print the values before and after calling
    the functions.  Use function overloading. [(Solution)](Basics/swap.cpp)
  1. Write a program that reads x and y coordinates from standard input,
    it computes and writes the distance of the corresponding point with
    respect to the origin. [(Solution)](Basics/col_dist.cpp)
  1. Write a program that reads integers from standard input, and computes
    the sum. It should ignore input lines that start with `#`.
    [(Solution)](Basics/data_parser.cpp)
