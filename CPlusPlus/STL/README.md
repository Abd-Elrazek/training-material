# STL
Some sample code for using the STL library.

## What is it?
1. `list_stl.cpp`: very basic illustration of using STL lists.
1. `map_tl.cpp`: very basic illustration of using STL maps, and `auto`
    type.
1. `rpn_calc.cpp`: implementation of a simple calculater for integer
    arithmetic expression in reverse Polish notation.  Illustrates use
    of a stack, a tuple, tokenizaiton, and simple exceptions.
1. `set_stl.cpp`: very basic illustration of using STL sets.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the sample code.
