# Boost
Some illustrations of using the Boost C++ library, mainly in the
context of mathematics (vector and matrix operations, and solving
ordinary differential equations).

## What is it?
1. `boost_vector.cpp`: illustration of vectors and vector operations
    using Boost.
1. `Odeint`: using the Boost odeint library to solve a set of ordinary
    differential equations.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the code.
