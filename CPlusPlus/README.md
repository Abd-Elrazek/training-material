# CPlusPlus
This is some sample code written in C++, with no or little bearing on
non-standard libraries.  It is mainly intended to illustrate some
programming concepts and idiosyncracies particular to C++.

## What is it?

    from the perspective of scientific computing, based on
    Bjarne Stroustrup's "A tour of C++", Addison Wesley, 2014.
1. `Basics`: illustration of basic C++ features for the presentation.
1. `UserDefinedTypes`: illustrations of user diefined types in C++ for
    the presentation.
1. `Modularity`: illustrations of modularity in C++ for the
    presentation.
1. `Classes`: illustration of classes in C++ for the presentation.
1. `Templates`: illustration of templates in C++ for the presentation.
1. `Regexes`: illustrations of strings and regular expressions in C++
    for the presentation.
