Matplotlib
==========

Matplotlib is the de facto standard to create scientific plots when using
Python.


What is it?
-----------
1. `function_plot.py`: plots the amplitude of an ideal, damped pendulum.
   It illustrates how to plot multiple curves on the same plot, how to set
   axis labels, a title, and arbitrary annotation.
2. `distribution_plot.py`: takes a file as input and plots the values as a
   histogram.  Optionally, it can superimpose a specified theoretical
   distribution as well.
