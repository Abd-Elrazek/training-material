# Bokeh
Bokeh is a library to create interactive plots easily from a number of
programming languages, including Python.  The result is saved to an HTML
page that can be viewed with any modern browser.

## What is it?
1. `function_plot.py`: a simple script to plot multiple functions on the
    same figure.
1. `ising.py`: Visualizes the graphical solution to the equation of the
    magnetization of the 2D Ising model in the mean field approximation.
    The temperature (i.e., beta = 1/T) can be varied using a slider.
