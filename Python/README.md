Python
======

Python is an excellent programming language for data processing,
prototyping and writing glue code for C/C++/Fortran libraries.

This directory contains code samples that illustrate particular features
and programming techniques, or how to use Python iibraries.  Many of
these samples have been used for Python tutorials.

What is it?
-----------
1. `ArgParse`: illustration of how to use the argparse module to handle
   command line arguments.
2. `CLibsFromPython`: illustrate how to use a C library from a Python
   script.
3. `ConfigParser`: illustrates how to use the ConfigParser module to handle
   configuration files.
4. `ContextManager`: illustrates the concept of a context manager, a
   mechanism to deal with resource setup/teardown.
5. `Coroutines`: illustrates coroutines, functions that preserve state
   between invocations.
6. `DataFormats`: illustrates how to deal with data formats such as CSV
   files, binary data and XML.
7. `DbAccess`: illustrates how to insert data into a relational database
   and query it.
8. `Decorators`: illustrates how to create decorators to wrap functions.
9. `Exec`: illustrates executing a shell command from a Python script
   using the `subprocess` module.
10. `Exercises`: example solutions to exercises to be found in the 
   Powerpoint presentation; this is part of the "Python as a data
   processing language" training session.
11. `FiniteStateParser`: illustrates how to parse a file that is structured
   as a regular language.  A `pyparsing` example is also given.
12. `Interfacing_C_C++_Fortran`: illustrates how to use Fortran code
    from Python using `f2py`, C code by using `ctype`, and C/C++ code
    using SWIG.
13. `Logging`: illustration of Python's logging facilities.
14. `Matplotlib`: a few illustrations of how to use the `pyplot` module.
15. `Matrices`: a few timings of matrix-matrix multiplications using
   LoL in Python, the numpy.dot function, a Fortran matmul and DGEMM, and
   a straightforward C implementation.
16. `python-intro.pptx`: Powerpoint presentation on Python as a data
   processing language, exercises for the corresponding training session
   can be found in the `Exercsises` directory.
