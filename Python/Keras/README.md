# Keras
Keras is a framework for machine learning, specically deep learning.
This directory contains a number of examples of using Keras for various
machine learning tasks.

## What is it?
1. `activation_functions.ipynb`: jupyter notebook illustrating some
    activation functions for deep learning applications.
1. `Data`: directory containing data for various machine learning tasks.
1. `kaggle_data.py`: Python module to easily load various Kaggle datasets
    and preprocess the data.
1. `keras.ipynb`: simple example of using Keras for a classification task.
1. `mnist.ipynb`: jupyter notebook implementing an MLP and an CNN to
    recognize handwritten digits using Keras.  The data is the MNIST
    data set.
