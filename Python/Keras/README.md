# Keras
Keras is a framework for machine learning, specically deep learning.
This directory contains a number of examples of using Keras for various
machine learning tasks.

## What is it?
1. `activation_functions.ipynb`: jupyter notebook illustrating some
    activation functions for deep learning applications.
1. `mnist_data_exploration.ipynb`: jupyter notebook exploring the MNIST
    data set.
1. `mnist_mlp.ipynb`: jupyter notebook implementing two multilayer
    perceptron models to learn the MNIST data set.
1. `mnist_cnn.ipynb`: jupyter notebook implementing two convolutional
    neural network models to learn the MNIST data set.
1. `mnist_ensemble.ipynb`: jupyter notebook that implements a somewhat
    silly ensemble of three MLP networks.
