# SystemProgramming

This is example code on how to do systems programming in Python.


## What is it?

  1. `shell_interaction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook illustrating the use
     of the `sh` and `subprocess` modules to interact with the shell.
  1. `system_information.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook illustrating how to
     use several standard library modules to retrieve information from
     the operating system.
  1. `julia.ipynb`: illustration of monitoring a running process.
  1. `compressed_files.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook illustrating how to
     work with compressed files and archives.
  1. `ssh_interaction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook illustrating how to
     execute commands via SSH on a remote machine, and how to transfer
     files using SFTP.
  1. `subprocess_environment.py`: script illustrating how to set
     environment variables for processes run via `subprocess`.
  1. `sys_info.py`: script illustrating how to retrieve information
     from the operating system, the Python environment, and so on.
  1. `config_args.py`: script illustrating how to use options in a
     default configuration file that can be overridden by a
     configuration file specified on the command line, that can be
     overridden by command line arguments.
  1. `system.conf`: default configuration file for `config_args.py`.
  1. `user.conf`: command line configuration file for `config_args.py`.
