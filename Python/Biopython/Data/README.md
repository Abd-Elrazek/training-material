# Data
Some data to use with the Biopython example scripts.

## What is it?
1. `*.gbk`: result files for a GenBank search to compare, but also for
    local processing so as not to put unnecessary load on the Entrez
    webservices.
1. `aligned_14666.fasta`: FASTA format file resulting from multiple
    sequence alignment with MUSCLE using `unaligned_14666.fasta` as
    input.
1. `blast.fasta`: sequence to use as input for an NCBI BLAST search.
1. `blast.fasta.xml`: search result for `blast.fasta`to compare, but
    also to allow local processing so as not to put unnecessary load
    on the NCBI webservices.
1. `crab.tree`: Newick file to use as input for the phylogentics scriot.
1. `unaligned_14666.fasta`: sample FASTA format file containing multiple
    sequences.
