* CDS: The coding region of a gene, also known as the coding sequence
    or CDS (from coding DNA sequence), is that portion of a gene's DNA
    or RNA, composed of exons, that codes for protein. 
* exon: An exon is any part of a gene that will become a part of the
    final mature RNA produced by that gene after introns have been
    removed by RNA splicing. The term exon refers to both the DNA
    sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA
    transcripts. In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are
    covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature
    messenger RNA.
* STS: A sequence-tagged site (or STS) is a short (200 to 500 base pair)
    DNA sequence that has a single occurrence in the genome and whose
    location and base sequence are known.
    STSs can be easily detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
    using specific primers. For this reason they are useful for
    constructing genetic and physical maps from sequence data reported
    from many different laboratories. They serve as landmarks on the
    developing physical map of a genome.
