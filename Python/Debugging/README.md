# Debugging

Some code used to illustrate the Python `pdb` debugger.

## What is it?
1. `buggy.py`: classical list of references versus list of lists bug.
1. `correct.py`: fixed version.
1. `matrix_utils.py`: code to pretty print a matrix, intended as a module
    to be loaded from within the debug session.
