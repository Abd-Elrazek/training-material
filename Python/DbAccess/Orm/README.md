# Database access
SQLAlchemy also support an object-relational mapping approach,
which is also illustrated by sample code.


## What is it?
1. `create_sqlalchemy_db.py`: implements two classes representing SQL
    tables, and creates them in an RDBMS using SQLAlchemy's
    object-relational mapping mechanisms
1. `fill_sqlalchemy_db.py`: adds data using SQLAlchemy's ORM mechanisms
1. `query_sqlalchemy_db.py`: queries the RDBMS using SQLAlchemy's ORM
    mechanisms
1. `update_sqlalchemy_db.py`: illustrates updating values using SQLAlchemy's
   ORM mechanisms
