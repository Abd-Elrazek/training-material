# Simple
A very simple illustration of using the `pytest` unit testing framework.

## What is it?
1. `fac.py`: implements the factorial function, and is a script to
    compute its value for 0 up to a value specified on the command line.
1. `test_fac.py`: `pytest` code to test `fac.py`.

## How to use it?
Make sure `pytest` is installed, run it with:
```bash
$ pytest
```
