BioPython
=========

BioPython is the de facto standard to handle biological sequence data
and perfrm various bioinformatics computations.

What is it?
-----------
1. `read_seq.py`: read a seqeunce file, e.g., in FASTA format, and
    compute some statistics on the sequences.
1. `align_seqs.py`: read a sequence file with multiple sequencs in,
    e.g., FASTA format, and perform a multiple alightment using MUSCLE.
1. `UnalignedSeq14666.fasta`: sample FASTA format file containing multiple
    sequences.
