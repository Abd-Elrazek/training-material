EvaluateCode
============

Python allows executino of Python source code at runtime.  Although this
is a powerful feature, it should be used with extreme care, since it can
give rise to serious security issues.

What is it?
-----------
1. `evaluate.py`: short example that reads a code fragment, evaluates it,
    and prints all values of variables defined in that code fragment.
    Only variables of type `int`, '`float`, `str`, `bool` and `list` will
    be printed.`
1. `source.py`: sample code to evaluate.
