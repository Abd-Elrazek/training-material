# CodeCoverage
Illustrates how to use a code coverage tool for Python.

## What is it?
* `prog.py`: a simle Python program with a few execution paths.
* `functions.py`: two functions that can be called from `prog.py`.
* `Makefile`: runs the application in two modes, and produces the
    summary reports, as well as the annotated source code for each run.
