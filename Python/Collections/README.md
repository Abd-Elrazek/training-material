Collections
===========

Although Python has many useful data types built-in, the `collections`,
part of its standard library, module contains a number of quite useful
additional ones.

What is it?
-----------
1. `points.py`: illustration of the use of `namedtuple`, a data type that
    represents a tuple that has elements that can be addressed by names,
    in addition to index.  This example also shows how to use `itertools`
    `combinations` iterator, as well as an interesting string format.
