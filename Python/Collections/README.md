Collections
===========

Although Python has many useful data types built-in, the `collections`,
part of its standard library, module contains a number of quite useful
additional ones.

What is it?
-----------
1. `points.py`: illustration of the use of `namedtuple`, a data type that
    represents a tuple that has elements that can be addressed by names,
    in addition to index.  This example also shows how to use `itertools`
    `combinations` iterator, as well as an interesting string format.
1. `ordered_dict.py`: counts characters from standard input, and stores
    counts in an `OrderedDict` so that the output reflects the order of
    the first occurence in the text.
1. `counter.py`: counts characters from stardard input, but uses a
    `Counter` to store the results.  The three most common characters are
    listed using the `most_common` method.
1. `text.txt`: text file to experiment with.
