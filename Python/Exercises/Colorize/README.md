# Colorize

This is a very simple application to illustrate how to (manually)
add style to terminal output.  Note that nice packages are
available if you don't mind the dependencies.

The functionality has been implemented in a single function.

## What is it?

1. `colorize.py`: can be used as a module, or as an application
   for demo purposes.
