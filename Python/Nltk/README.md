# Nltk
Natural Language ToolKit is a large collection of tools for linguistic
analysis.

## What is it?
1. `ms_word.py`: parsing Microsoft Word documents (`.docx` format) to extract the actual text. This can be used as a preprocessing step for natural language processing code.
1. `nltk_experiments.ipynb`: iPython notebook showing some very naive
    experiments with NLTK.
1. `test.docx`: relatively simple Microsoft Word document to illustrate `ms_word.py`.

## Note
The `python-docx` package is not part of `ntlk`, and has to be installed separately.
