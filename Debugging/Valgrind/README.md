# Valgrind
Illustration of using valgrind to detect three problems:
  * variable `m` is not initialized;
  * array index gets out of bounds;
  * memory leak.

Note that this depends on the version of GCC (7.3 is used here), and
not using `-O2` for compilation.

## What is it?
1. `valgrind.cpp`: problematic C++ code.
1. `valgrind.txt`: output generated by valgrind.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the application and run valgrind.

## How to use it?
To build, run make:
```bash
$ make
```

To run valgrind, run
```bash
make checks
```
