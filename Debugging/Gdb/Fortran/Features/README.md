# Tree
Implementation of an n-ary tree mainly to demonstrate features of the
GDB debugger.

## What is it?
1. `command_channge.f90`: simple application to show how to use a
    conditional breakpoint, GDB variables and `command` to specifically
    monitor for change.
1. `display_demo.f90`: very simple application to illustrate using
    `display`, `command`, and `dprintf`.
1. `tree_mod.f90`: user defined type implementing nodes for n-ary trees.
1. `tree.f90`: Fortran application to illustrate the use of the n-ary
    tree implementation.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the applications.
