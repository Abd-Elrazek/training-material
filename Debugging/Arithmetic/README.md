# Arithmetic
Some illustrations of arithmetic bugs.

## What is this?
1. `addition.py`: illustration of loss of precision when adding numbers
    of different orders of magnitude.
1. `addition.c`: C implementation of illustration of loss of precision
    when adding numbers of different orders of magnitude.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the applications.
