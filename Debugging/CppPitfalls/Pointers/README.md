# Pointers

Pointers and references can have some interesting properties and differences.

## What is it?

  1. `pointers_vs_references.cpp`: a different address can be reassigned to
    a C++ pointer.  However, a reference always refers to the same object.
  1. `Makefile`: make file to build the applicatons.
