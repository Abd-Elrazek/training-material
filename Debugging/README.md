# Debugging
Some sample code to illustrate the use of debugging tools.  Also some unit
testing code is shown, since trying to prevent bugs is better than fixing
them.

## What is it?
1. `Arithmetic`: illustrations of arithmetic bugs.
1. `Catch2`: very simple illustrations of using Catch2 for C++ unit
    testing and BDD.
1. `Const`: illustrates some subtleties of `const` declarations in C/C++.
1. `ControlFlow`: illustrations of bugs in the control flow.
1. `MemoryIssues`: sample code to illustrate various memory issues.
1. `CodeCoverage`: illustration of how to use code coverage tools.
1. `CompilerFlags`: illustration of the value of specifying maximal warnings
    when compiling, as well as trying multiple compilers.
1. `CppAlgorithms`: illustration of C++ specific bugs.
1. `CppCheck`: illustration of what the Cppcheck static analyzer can catch.
1. `CUnit`: very simple illustration of how to use the CUnit testing
    framework for testing C code.
1. `debugging.pptx`: Microsoft Powerpoint presentation on defensive
    programming, testing and debugging techniques.
1. `DropIn`: illustration of how to write drop-in replacements for functions
    in libraries.
1. `fUnit`: very simple illustration of how to use the fUnit testing
    framework for Fortran unit testing.
1. `Gdb`: some sample code to illustrate using GDB.
1. `GitBisect`: illustration of using `git bisect` to find the first bad
    commit.
1. `MemDump`: experiment to visualize layout of variables in memory.
1. `MPI`: MPI code to illustrate using Allinea DDT.
1. `Pfunit`: very simple illustration of how to use the pFUnit testing
	framework for Fortran unit testing.
1. `Qmtest`: illustration of how to use QMTest for integration testing.
1. `Shunit2`: illustration of how to use shunit2 for integration testing.
1. `SyntaxSemantics`: trivial examples of syntax versus semantic errors in
    code.
