# Debugging
Some sample code to illustrate the use of debugging tools.  Also some unit
testing code is shown, since trying to prevent bugs is better than fixing
them.

## What is it?
1. `CUnit`: very simple illustration of how to use the CUnit testing
    framework for testing C code.
1. `debugging.pptx`: Microsoft Powerpoint presentation on defensive
    programming, testing and debugging techniques.
1. `Gdb`: some sample code to illustrate using GDB.
1. `MPI`: MPI code to illustrate using Allinea DDT.
