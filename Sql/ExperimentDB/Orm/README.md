# Orm
Sample object-relational mapping (ORM) code implemented in Pythno's
`sqlalchemy`.  Note that the database schema is not the same as that of
the SQL examples in the parent directory.

TODO: make schemas on slides, in SQL examples and ORM code consistent

## What is it?
1. `create.py`: define classes and tables, and create database schema.
1. `fill.py`: add some data to the database, illustrating back references.
1. `view.py`: illustrate using back references when using objects.
