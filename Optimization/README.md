# Optimization
Needless to say that optimization is a rather important topic in HPC.

A collection of code samples that illustrate opportunities for code
optimization, or highlight potential performance bottlenecks.

## What is it?
1. `Fdo`: small illustration of using FDO (Feedback Directed Optimization).
1. `GalleryProcessorCacheEffects`: C implementations of the code examples
    given in Igor Ostrovsky's interesting blog post on effects the various
    caching mechanisms in a modern CPU can have on performance.  See the
    following URL for his original post:
