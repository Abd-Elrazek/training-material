# Data storage

Data storage is a non-trivial issue in the context of high performance
and scientific computing.  Several approaches are illustrated here.

## What is it?
1. `Hdf5`: data format that supports hierarchical and platform independent,
    storage and annotation.
1. `NetCDF`: data format that supports hierarchical and platform
    independent, storage and annotation.
1. `Redis`: high performance data structure server.
1. `Sql`: some examples of interacting with and the design of relational
    databases for storing, e.g., research data.
