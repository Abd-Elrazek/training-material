# Hdf5
HDF5 is a versatile data format to store scientific data.  It provides
portable storage of binary data, hierachical storage, annotation and more.

HDF5 APIs are available for many programming language, e.g., C, Fortran,
Java, Python.

Here, a number of examples are provided on how to use the various APIs.

## What is it?
1. `CSamples`: illustrates how to read and write HDF5 files from C, using
    both the high-level interface and the ordinary one.
1. `FortranSamples`: illustrates how to read and write HDF5 files from
    Fortran.
1. `MatlabSamples`: trivial example how to read a dataset out of a HDF5
    file from Matlab.
1. `ParallelCSamples`: illstrates checkpointing of parallel applications
    using HDF5 as data format.
1. `PythonSamples`: illustrates how to read and write HDF5 files from
    Python using `pyTables`.
