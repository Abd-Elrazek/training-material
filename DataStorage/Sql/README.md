# Sql
SQL is a standard language for querying relational database systems such
as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, IBM DB2, or SQLite.  Although SQL is
standardized, there are differences between implementation.  The sample
SQL here works with SQLite since this is the easiest way to start
learning SQL.

## What is it?
1. `Basics`: some basic SQL examples
1. `ExperimentDB`: some tutorial material with an emphasis on database
    schema design in third normal form.

## Requirements
Any relational database system should do, though if you don't have any
available, you can easily install and use SQlite, see
https://www.sqlite.org/
